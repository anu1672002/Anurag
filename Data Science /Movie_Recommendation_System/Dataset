TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

Background
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain 
companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing 
over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to 
the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films 
will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?

This is a great place to start digging into those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, 
budget, and revenues of several thousand films
